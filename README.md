## 📜 Abstract
 
4D radar measurements offer an affordable and weather-robust solution for 3D perception. However, the inherent
sparsity and noise of radar point clouds present significant challenges for accurate 3D object detection, underscoring the
need for effective and robust point clouds densification. Despite recent progress, existing densification methods often fail to address the extreme sparsity of 4D radar point clouds and exhibit limited robustness when processing scenes with a small number of points. In this paper, we propose SD4R, a novel framework that transforms sparse radar point clouds into dense representations. SD4R begins by utilizing a foreground point generator (FPG) to mitigate noise propagation and produce densified point clouds. Subsequently, a logit-query encoder (LQE) enhances conventional pillarization, resulting in robust feature representations. Through these innovations, our SD4R demonstrates strong capability in both noise reduction and foreground point densification. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available View of-Delft dataset demonstrate that SD4R achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Architecture of our SD4R neural network.
(a)  The proposed SD4R pipeline begins with voxelization of 4D radar point cloud, followed by processing through the VoteHead. This step predicts offsets between points and their corresponding object centers, classification logits, and point-wise features. These point-wise features are then concatenated with the logits to classify the point clouds. Subsequently, virtual points are generated at positions determined by the offsets, resulting in a densified point cloud. 
(b)  The densified point cloud undergoes pillarization to extract features. To further address the sparsity of radar data, we introduce a logit-query encoder (LQE) module, which aggregates features from neighboring points into pillars, leading to more robust representations. Finally, the detection head processes these features to generate the final detection outputs.
